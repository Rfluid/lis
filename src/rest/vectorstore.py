Upload one or more text-based files to be stored in the vector database.

**Accepted file types:**
- Plain text files (`.txt`)
- JSON files (`.json`)
- CSV files (`.csv`)

**Requirements:**
- Files must be UTF-8 decodable.
- Each file will be embedded and stored along with its metadata (`filename`, `content_type`).

**Notes:**
- Binary files (e.g., images, PDFs, Word documents) are not supported in this endpoint.
- To add richer document types (e.g., PDF, DOCX), use specialized extraction endpoints.
